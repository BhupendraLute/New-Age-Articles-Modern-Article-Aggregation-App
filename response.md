    'The belief that technology will usher in a golden age for humanity is in vogue once more with billionaires. But can the left offer its own vision for the future?\n' +

    'Techno-optimism – the belief that technology will usher in a golden age for humanity – is in vogue once more.\n' +

    'In 2022, a clutch of pseudonymous San Francisco [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai) scenesters published a Substack post entitled “Effective Accelerationism”, which argued for maximum acceleration of technological advancement. The 10-point manifesto, which proclaimed that “the next evolution of consciousness, creating unthinkable next-generation lifeforms and silicon-based awareness” was imminent, quickly went viral, as did follow-up posts.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Effective accelerationism, or “e/acc”, exploded from being a fringe movement dedicated to pushing back against AI extinction-fearing “doomers” to being name-checked by major Silicon Valley CEOs such as Garry Tan, the CEO of the start-up accelerator Y Combinator; [Sam Altman](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/sam-altman), the head of OpenAI; Marc Andreessen, the billionaire software engineer; and [Elon Musk](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk).\n' +
    '\n' +
    'In 2023, Andreessen issued his Techno-Optimist Manifesto, expanding beyond the e/acc’s focus on AI to encompass all questions of technological progress. “We are told to be angry, bitter, and resentful about technology,” he writes, yet previously and for hundreds of years, we had glorified it. The enemies of techno-optimism are, he says, statism, economic planning and socialism. Andreessen tells us: “Technology is the glory of human ambition and achievement, the spearhead of progress, and the realization of our potential … It is time, once again, to raise the technology flag.”\n' +
    '\n' +
    'And last year saw the release of the Techno-Humanist Manifesto from the Roots of Progress Institute and Jason Crawford, who makes similar arguments for the liberatory power of technology, while also [arguing](https://x.com/jasoncrawford/status/1810426698158252361?s=61&t=ptV-bnZdHxrJCT9WTAVCIw) that anything that can be for profit should be.\n' +

    'One would think that in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw the market flounder and the state rise to the occasion with responses such as Operation War Speed’s vaccine development and rollouts, the left would be crowing about how it produced technological progress far better than all this market fundamentalism.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'It was the embrace of varieties of economic planning that produced the innovation needed to defeat the virus. For decades, large firms had gotten out of the business of vaccine development because it was insufficiently profitable. The mRNA vaccine delivery vehicle that is now recognized as [revolutionary](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02061-1) for the life sciences far beyond Covid had been [sitting on the shelf](https://ifp.org/progress-deferred-lessons-from-mrna-vaccine-development/) for about a decade, spurned by uninterested, risk-averse investors.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'At the start of the pandemic, big pharma remained wary that transmission might fizzle out and they’d be left having spent billions on a white elephant. Instead, it was the advance purchase agreements, subsidies and coordination of the government – which does not need to turn a profit – via the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (Barda) and Operation Warp Speed that delivered the vaccine and saved the world.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Meanwhile, free-market driven distribution of PPE, ventilators, medical fridges and oxygen had [produced](https://jacobin.com/2021/04/neoliberal-state-failure-covid-19-vaccine-distribution) little more than corruption, bottlenecks and irrational allocation to those who could pay the highest price – not allocation where it was most needed. It was only when the White House deployed the Defense Production Act to enable the government to takeover distribution that the market’s deadly mess was cleared up.\n' +

    '> The left should be proudly flaunting the record of governments around the world in responding to Covid\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The left should be proudly flaunting the record of governments around the world in responding to Covid. It should make the case that all major technological and scientific advancements are best delivered by governments. And it should make the case that we – the people – should embrace faith in technological progress that is rooted in public investment.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'In other words, the left should be the real techno-optimists. But instead, in recent years, there has been a growing skepticism of technology on the contemporary left – from cynicism about space-faring to fear of genetic engineering and opposition to nuclear power.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The left should be calling for government intervention to ensure decarbonization of data centers for AI. It should demand that we direct machine-learning research to prioritize the solving of grand scientific challenges such as [prediction of protein folding](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-demis-hassabis.html) instead of bad fantasy art fabrication and plagiarism. But instead, the most [popular leftwing tech podcast](https://x.com/parismarx/status/1809223643676754098?s=61&t=ptV-bnZdHxrJCT9WTAVCIw) calls for degrowth of generative AI and data centers due the latter’s carbon intensity.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Progressives could be reminding the world of Neil Armstrong’s [warning](https://www.space.com/14936-spacex-ceo-elon-musk-60-minutes-interview.html) about the privatization of space – while still cheering on SpaceX’s work to develop reusable rocketry, radically reducing the cost of humans and payloads escaping our planet’s gravity well, all the better to deliver the space and planetary science we need to monitor and solve so many ecological challenges.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'We could be explaining how space colonization, a worthwhile multigenerational, perhaps millennia-long endeavor, will be public sector-led or it will not happen, due to the risible likelihood of it being profitable. Musk won’t get to Mars without Nasa. But instead the left [declares](https://www.societyandspace.org/articles/the-settler-logics-of-outer-space) space-faring to be settler-colonialism, oddly equating lifeless rocks with Indigenous peoples.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Environmentalists and green NGOs should be celebrating research into genetically modified crops that if successful will reduce pesticide use, nitrogen pollution and land-use change. But instead, anti-GMO campaign groups [vandalized](https://www.science.org/content/article/landmark-gene-edited-rice-crop-destroyed-italy) an Italian research trial of rice-blast-resistant arborio (risotto) rice this summer, while Greenpeace successfully [convinced](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/25/greenpeace-blocks-planting-of-lifesaving-golden-rice-philippines) a Filipino court to overturn approval of commercial cultivation of Golden Rice, a variety modified to combat vitamin A deficiency, which causes blindness and even death in tens of thousands of children annually in Asia.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'This leftwing technophobia is something of an historic aberration. Traditionally, the left had always been enthusiastic about the potential of technology for liberation, to release us from drudgery and boundlessly expand our degrees of freedom – so long as technology was unfettered from the irrationality of profit and hierarchy and yoked to egalitarian reason. Prometheus plus Spartacus, as mid-century Marxist Hal Draper put it.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'We sometimes forget that the Communist Manifesto was itself a techno-optimist declaration of intent. It was a critique of capitalism but it was also a celebration of the new technologies, both industrial and social, that this system had set loose.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'From Karl Marx’s enthusiasm for the Industrial Revolution through to British Labour prime minister Harold Wilson’s call to harness the “white heat” of the Scientific Revolution, the conventional left position was that its programme would enable society to _surpass_ the technological progress of mere capitalism. The point was not to retreat from capitalism, but instead to advance from it. We the people would develop the “forces of production” much more rapidly through conscious, democratic planning (albeit to greater or lesser degrees of such planning, depending on the flavour of leftist) rather than leaving such development to the fetters imposed by the risk-averse, poorly coordinated and unconscious anarchy of the market.\n' +

    'Scientific, technological and industrial development would not only be faster, but broader, for the left would share the fruits of development with all humanity as rapidly as economic capacity would allow, rather than limiting their spread to those
